To use **vitest-cucumber**, you first need to understand [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/). Gherkin is a language for writing structured, human-readable specifications. It uses keywords like `Feature`, `Scenario`, and `Given`/`When`/`Then` to describe how software should behave.

To write a Gherkin specification, create a `.feature` file:

~~~gherkin
Feature: User login
  Users should be able to log in with valid credentials

  Scenario: Valid credentials
    Given a registered user
    When they enter valid credentials
    Then they are logged in
~~~

<Aside>
**vitest-cucumber** implements the [Gherkin specification](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/) and lets you use your *feature* files as complete *Vitest* test suites. To set it up, see the [Vitest plugin](/integrations/setup) integration or use the [serializer](/integrations/serializer) to generate documentation from your *feature* files.

## Generating a spec file

To save time, you can generate a spec file automatically from a *feature* file via the CLI:

~~~bash
npx @amiceli/vitest-cucumber --feature <path-to-feature> --spec <path-to-spec> --lang <en:optional>
~~~

Example:

~~~bash
npx @amiceli/vitest-cucumber --feature features/example.feature --spec src/__tests__/example.spec.ts
~~~

To parse a *feature* file in a different language, use the `--lang` option:

~~~bash
npx @amiceli/vitest-cucumber --feature features/example.feature --spec src/__tests__/example.spec.ts --lang fr
~~~

By default the *feature* file is parsed with `en` language.
